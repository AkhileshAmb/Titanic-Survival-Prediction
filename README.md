# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

A machine learning project that predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using historical data.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the famous Titanic dataset to build a predictive model that determines whether a passenger would have survived the disaster based on their characteristics.

## Key Findings
- **Women had 74% survival rate** vs men's 19%
- **1st class passengers** had the highest survival rate
- **Age and family size** also influenced survival chances

## Model Performance
- **Algorithm Used:** Random Forest Classifier
- **Accuracy Achieved:** 79.3%
- **Features Used:** Gender, Passenger Class, Age

## Files in this Repository

- `titanic-survival-prediction.ipynb` - Main Jupyter notebook with complete analysis
- `Titanic-Dataset.csv` - Dataset used for training and testing
- `README.md` - Project documentation

## How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter
2. Upload the CSV dataset
3. Run all cells sequentially
4. The model will train and make predictions automatically

## What I Learned

- Data exploration and visualization
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Machine learning model training
